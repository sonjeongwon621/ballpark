    "##### The focus of this paper is twofold.\n",
    "- Create a Brock Mirman type growth model with uninsured idiosyncratic income shocks and liquidity constraints.\n",
    "- Quantitatively assess the relative importance of individual precautionary motives for aggregate saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Empirical evidence in favor of uninsured idiosyncratic risk (heterogeneity due to incomplete markets)\n",
    "- Individual consumption is much more variable than aggregate consumption\n",
    "- Individual consumption patterns are not highly correlated with each other or with aggregate consumption\n",
    "- High mobility across wealth deciles\n",
    "- Wide disparities in portfolio composition depending on wealth\n",
